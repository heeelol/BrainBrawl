**Proposed Level of Achievement**

Apollo 11 â€” We aim to go beyond basic features with real-time multiplayer, gamification, and user progression systems, fully deployed with complete documentation and UI polish.
	
**Aim**

BrainBrawl seeks to make studying fun by combining competitive gaming with academic quizzes. The goal is to create a platform where students revise through real-time 1v1 battles, gain XP, level up, and customize avatars, transforming boring study sessions into exciting challenges.

**Motivation**

The motivation behind this project is to make studying more engaging and exciting, so that they will learn concepts more effectively and hence be better equipped with relevant toolsets for the future. Traditional revision methods can feel monotonous, leading to procrastination. By introducing gamification, like 1v1 battles, level-ups, and interactive feedback, this app aims to encourage consistent learning habits while keeping users motivated.

**One-Sentence Scope**

A real-time quiz battle app that gamifies learning through XP, leveling, and custom avatars.

**Descriptive Scope**

BrainBrawl is a full-stack MERN web app that turns quiz-based revision into a competitive and fun experience. Players challenge others in live quiz duels, earn experience, and unlock avatar customizations. A leaderboard tracks global rankings while the integrated shop and cosmetic features keep users invested and progressing.

**User Stories**

1. As a student who wants to revise effectively, I want to participate in quizzes so that I can test and improve my knowledge.
2. As a competitive user who enjoys challenges, I want to engage in 1v1 quiz battles so that I can compete and level up.
3. As a learner who values progress tracking, I want to view my performance history and level progression to stay motivated.

**Tech Stack**

- Frontend: React + Vite + TailwindCSS
- Backend: Node.js + Express.js
- Database: MongoDB (hosted via MongoDB Atlas)
- Auth: JWT + bcrypt
- Version Control: Git + GitHub
- Design: Canva (posters), Draw.io (flowcharts), Figma (UI mockups)

**Core Features**

**Login & Registration (implemented âœ…)**

As BrainBrawl is a personalized, gamified quiz app, each user requires a secure and unique account to track progress, XP, and unlockables.

BrainBrawl currently supports account registration and login using email and password, with secure session management. The system is designed with best practices for authentication and user safety, using industry-standard libraries and database security principles.

Using the backend authentication logic implemented in Node.js + Express, and a MySQL database, users can:

- Create an account using email and password

- Log in using valid credentials

- Receive an authentication token (JWT) to access protected features

- Interact with the dashboard only when authenticated

Upon user registration, the password is hashed securely with bcrypt before storing in the database. During login, the backend verifies the password and returns a signed JWT token, which the frontend uses to access protected routes. Input validation is performed to prevent malformed or insecure data.

The API responds with appropriate messages for invalid inputs, and all authentication-related errors are handled gracefully on both the frontend and backend.

**Quiz System with Question Pool (Basic Version implemented âœ…)**

The quiz system allows users to take quizzes from a pool of questions, with various topics to choose from, providing a variety of engaging quizzes that keeps users interested.

For now, there is only one topic available, which is "General Knowledge". The quiz system is designed to be extensible, allowing for easy addition of new topics and questions in the future.

Currently, the quiz system is entirely frontend-based, with the questions and answers written down in a JavaScript file. When the quiz starts, the system retrieves the questions and their options from the JavaScript file, and the user is presented with these questions and multiple-choice answers, each question at a time. When the user selects an answer for a question, the system will check from the question data if it is correct or not. 

Once the user selects an option, the answer will be revealed instantly, and the user cannot select any other options and has to move onto the next question. If the answer is correct, the user gains 1 point, and if it is incorrect, the user does not lose or gain any points.

After the quiz ends, the user is presented with their score (the number of questions answered correctly). Then the user can exit the quiz interface and return to the dashboard.

In the future, the quiz will also use backend features, such as using the MongoDB database to store and retrieve question data, and more topics and multiplayer battles will be added. The system will also provide feedback on which questions were answered correctly or incorrectly, allowing users to learn from their mistakes.
