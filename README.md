**Proposed Level of Achievement**

Apollo 11 â€” We aim to go beyond basic features with real-time multiplayer, gamification, and user progression systems, fully deployed with complete documentation and UI polish.
	
**Aim**

BrainBrawl seeks to make studying fun by combining competitive gaming with academic quizzes. The goal is to create a platform where students revise through real-time 1v1 battles, gain XP, level up, and customize avatars, transforming boring study sessions into exciting challenges.

**Motivation**

The motivation behind this project is to make studying more engaging and exciting, so that they will learn concepts more effectively and hence be better equipped with relevant toolsets for the future. Traditional revision methods can feel monotonous, leading to procrastination. By introducing gamification, like 1v1 battles, level-ups, and interactive feedback, this app aims to encourage consistent learning habits while keeping users motivated.

**One-Sentence Scope**

A real-time quiz battle app that gamifies learning through XP, leveling, and custom avatars.

**Descriptive Scope**

BrainBrawl is a full-stack MERN web app that turns quiz-based revision into a competitive and fun experience. Players challenge others in live quiz duels, earn experience, and unlock avatar customizations. A leaderboard tracks global rankings while the integrated shop and cosmetic features keep users invested and progressing.

**User Stories**

1. As a student who wants to revise effectively, I want to participate in quizzes so that I can test and improve my knowledge.
2. As a competitive user who enjoys challenges, I want to engage in 1v1 quiz battles so that I can compete and level up.
3. As a learner who values progress tracking, I want to view my performance history and level progression to stay motivated.

**Tech Stack**

- Frontend: React + Vite + TailwindCSS
- Backend: Node.js + Express.js
- Database: MongoDB (hosted via MongoDB Atlas)
- Auth: JWT + bcrypt
- Version Control: Git + GitHub
- Design: Canva (posters), Draw.io (flowcharts), Figma (UI mockups)

**Core Features**

**Login & Registration (implemented âœ…)**

As BrainBrawl is a personalized, gamified quiz app, each user requires a secure and unique account to track progress, XP, and unlockables.

BrainBrawl currently supports account registration and login using email and password, with secure session management. The system is designed with best practices for authentication and user safety, using industry-standard libraries and database security principles.

Using the backend authentication logic implemented in Node.js + Express, and a MySQL database, users can:

- Create an account using email and password

- Log in using valid credentials

- Receive an authentication token (JWT) to access protected features

- Interact with the dashboard only when authenticated

Upon user registration, the password is hashed securely with bcrypt before storing in the database. During login, the backend verifies the password and returns a signed JWT token, which the frontend uses to access protected routes. Input validation is performed to prevent malformed or insecure data.

The API responds with appropriate messages for invalid inputs, and all authentication-related errors are handled gracefully on both the frontend and backend.
